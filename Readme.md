# Automated Grading System and Feedback

## Overview
Our project aims to revolutionize the grading process by leveraging the power of multiple Language Models (LLMs) to create an automated grading system and feedback. This system ensures unbiased and consistent evaluations for educational purposes.

## Features
- **Multiple LLMs:** We utilize a series of LLMs to avoid biases and ensure fairness in grading.
- **Polling Method:** Our system uses a polling method to determine evaluation metrics, enhancing objectivity.
- **User-Defined Grading Schemes:** Users can define grading schemes with expected answers, key points, and weightage for various criteria like creativity, relevance, and understanding.
- **Personalized Grading:** Tailored grading processes align with specific educational goals.
- **Detailed Feedback:** Detailed feedback is provided for each graded answer based on predefined metrics, fostering continuous improvement and deeper learning for students.

## Project Structure
- **assets:** Contains project assets such as images, icons, etc.
- **css:** Stylesheets for the frontend.
- **database:** Includes database related files, such as DB_temp for importing into MySQL.
- **doc:** Documentation files for the project.
- **font:** Fonts used in the project.
- **includes:** Shared components or includes used across the project.
- **Instructorpage:** Files related to the instructor interface.
- **js:** JavaScript files for frontend logic.
- **login-ui:** UI components for the login interface.
- **makefont:** Scripts or files related to font creation.
- **pages:** Individual pages of the application.
- **query:** Database query files.
- **Studentpage:** Files related to the student interface.
